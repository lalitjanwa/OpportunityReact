#  Opportunity Quote with Line Items



We created two components to meet the project needs: an Apex class (AccountOpportunityDataContact) and an LWC (accountOppQuoteComponent). The Apex class fetches open Opportunities, Quotes, and Quote Line Items for an Account in JSON format, which the LWC then uses to display data in the UI. This setup ensures streamlined data retrieval and display across Salesforce.

Below are the schema for the project.

As after checking found Opportunity and Quote have Master-Details same as Quote and Quote Line Item have Master-Details so get all these records into single query.
